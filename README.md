## Description 

This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 11. 
During Week 11 I learnt to differentiate between JavaScript in the browser and Node.js environments, and also ES6. 
My task was to apply the skills I got and make a command-line app that will dynamically generate a professional README file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.
